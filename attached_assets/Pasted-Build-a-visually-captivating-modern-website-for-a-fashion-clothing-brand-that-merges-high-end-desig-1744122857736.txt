Build a visually captivating, modern website for a fashion clothing brand that merges high-end design with artistic creativity and interactivity. Follow these instructions:

⸻

Visual Aesthetic
	•	Use a paper-like textured background to give an organic, analog vibe.
	•	Combine doodled/hand-drawn typography and icons throughout the site for a sketchbook-style brand identity.
	•	Employ a vibrant yet soft-light color palette (pastel neons, glowing gradients, creamy whites).
	•	Keep a modern, clean, and minimal layout, emphasizing negative space and strong typography.
	•	Ensure consistent branding through a design system (spacing, font sizes, color scales, button styles, etc.).

⸻

Interactive Elements & Animations
	•	Use GSAP (GreenSock) and/or Framer Motion for:
	•	Scroll-triggered animations.
	•	Smooth page/section transitions.
	•	Parallax effects on images, text, and backgrounds.
	•	3D transitions for elements like cards and buttons.
	•	Implement a custom animated cursor (e.g., expands on hover, reacts to buttons or images).
	•	Add lazy loading and entrance animations for each section on scroll.
